# Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

# For example:

#   stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

# get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# # returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

# No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
